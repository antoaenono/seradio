# SeRadio

Software Engineering Radio (SeRadio) is a web deployed radio player that will stream public domain music to connected users.

## With your group, choose a programming language. What language are you using and why?

JavaScript/TypeScript backend/frontend, using [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) to parse and serve audio to users. 

JS/TS are common and powerful choices for web development, and both have good support for building front/backend infrastructure (React/TS, Node.js/TS). They are also both highly transferable for future web development. 

We chose JS/TS for both front and back end to streamline conceptual development, and reduce context switching.
